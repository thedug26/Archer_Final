# Archer_Final
 The no kidding really final Archer game
The objective of this game is to score as many points as possible
The player can move the launch angle of the sprite arrow with the arrow keys and press spacebar to launch the arrow
The arrow follows a ballistic trajectory that has gravity and direction changes based on its velocity directions
If the arrow collides with the target, the soldier, a sprite of the soldier in pain will momentarily be displayed along with a short sound showing it was hit successfully
After 60 seconds, the final score will be printed that will encourage the player to beat it in the next attempt

All external help with this python game can be attributed to my companymate, Andrew Bernas, and teacher, CAPT Severson
